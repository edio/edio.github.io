surroundings people are usually not very zealous or overly excited, I do notice sometimes talks, discussions and vocally
expressed opinions where <em>tremendous</em> benefits of FP over other paradigms are claimed, through presenting FP as a
fundamentally new approach to writing code, opposite to, say, OOP. Some go as far as saying, that one must fully ditch
OOP and all related experience because it&#8217;s all just a mistake.</p></div><div class=paragraph><p>Such extreme claims are rarely challenged. When a person with an OOP background gets involved in any FP-related
discussion, it quickly gets overwhelmed with new unfamiliar vocabulary: algebras, monads, semigroups, functors, type
classes&#8230;&#8203; And I start questioning intents of those claims — are they made to make people shift to FP, or to prove, that
some definition of FP is better than some definition of OOP?</p></div><div class=paragraph><p>With this post, I hope to show that FP can be seen as an evolutionary step, a generalization over practices we already
consider the best in OOP paradigm. And if viewed like this, it can be useful even when adopted gradually. I hope this
point of view will persuade programmers to look into FP and to borrow new techniques from it to improve non-FP code.</p></div><div class=sect1><h2 id=cut>FP concepts we already use in OOP</h2><div class=sectionbody><div class=paragraph><p>I want to examine concepts, that are claimed (by some) to be unique to FP but are actually used in non-FP code too.</p></div><div class=sect2><h3 id=_pure_functions>Pure functions</h3><div class=paragraph><p>And for starters let&#8217;s examine what probably is considered the core concept of FP — pure functions.</p></div><div class=paragraph><p>A pure function must satisfy 2 properties:</p></div><div class=ulist><ul><li><p>its return value is the same for the same arguments,</p></li><li><p>its evaluation has no side effects.</p></li></ul></div><div class=paragraph><p>Let&#8217;s consider a simple issue tracking system.</p></div><div class=listingblock><div class=content><pre class="highlightjs highlight"><code data-lang=java class="language-java hljs">class Issue {

class Comment {
  long id;
  String text;
  long timestampMillis;
}</code></pre></div></div><div class=paragraph><p>Our task is to make issues to be closed automatically if they are stale. The issue is considered stale when no comments
were made on them over some time. If we just finished our first book about Java, we would probably come up with
something like this in our model.</p></div><div class=listingblock><div class=content><pre class="highlightjs highlight"><code data-lang=java class="language-java hljs">class Issue {

    return now - recentCommentTs &gt; STALE_THRESHOLD_MILLIS; // THRESHOLD declared elsewhere
  }
}</code></pre></div></div><div class=paragraph><p>Now if on our first job in a big company we tried to push a code like that to the repo, our colleagues or even static
code analysis system integrated into company CI would quickly let us know, that the code must be tested. So we read
about testing, TDD, and eventually, we&#8217;ll end up with hundreds of tabs in our browser, all describing how do we mock
system time in our tests&#8230;&#8203;</p></div><div class=paragraph><p>A more experienced OOP programmer who practices TDD wouldn&#8217;t even attempt writing code like that, and at the very least
would start with something like this, because it is easier to test:</p></div><div class=listingblock><div class=content><pre class="highlightjs highlight"><code data-lang=java class="language-java hljs">class Issue {

  }
}</code></pre></div></div><div class=paragraph><p>Even more experienced programmer would probably come up with something even more composable.</p></div><div class=paragraph><p>It is already easy to spot though, that <code>isStale()</code> as written by an imaginary junior programmer is not pure, it returns
different results depending on the state of the system clock. <code>isStale(long)</code> is still <em>not pure</em> because its result
depends on the state of the <code>Issue</code> object. Make <code>Issue</code> immutable and <code>isStale(long)</code> would be pure.</p></div><div class=paragraph><p>TDD is said to aid in good code design, but it is rarely mentioned or even understood, that it achieves this <em>mostly</em>
by forcing us to write programs that are composed of pure computations!</p></div><div class=paragraph><p>Testable code is a requirement worked out by the industry that gave birth to other practices that converge to functional
programming. Such a big one is dependency injection.</p></div><div class=paragraph><p>I still occasionally meet people, who associate dependency injection with magical frameworks like Spring and Guice. It
is however just a very simple technique: inject all dependencies needed for your computation, do not let your
computations produce those dependencies.</p></div><div class=listingblock><div class=content><pre class="highlightjs highlight"><code data-lang=java class="language-java hljs">class NonDiIssueService {

saw in <code>isStale()</code> and <code>isStale(now)</code> — both let us eliminate side effects and make our functions deterministic.</p></div><div class=paragraph><p>It turns out, through industry requirements OOP community came up with best practices that forced it to re-invent pure
functions in OOP.</p></div></div><div class=sect2><h3 id=_immutable_data_structures>Immutable data structures</h3><div class=paragraph><p>Immutable data structures are an inherent feature of FP. However, saying that you don&#8217;t have this in OOP would be just
silly.

remind you to make defensive copies of non-primitive types passed as arguments to avoid any unexpected mutability&#8230;&#8203;</p></li></ul></div><div class=paragraph><p>Ilya Suzdalnitski argues, that mutability is inherent to OOP<sup class=footnote>[<a id=_footnoteref_4 class=footnote href=#_footnotedef_4 title="View footnote.">4</a>]</sup>. Won&#8217;t
comment on the veracity of that, but let&#8217;s assume it is true. Is it bad?</p></div><div class=paragraph><p>Mutability is part of the nature of the hardware we run our programs on, it is hard to abstract away from it completely.
I&#8217;d argue, that as of now, it is just easier to build efficient applications that have confined mutable pieces in
them<sup class=footnote>[<a id=_footnoteref_5 class=footnote href=#_footnotedef_5 title="View footnote.">5</a>]</sup>.</p></div><div class=paragraph><p>To summarize, immutability may be not as ubiquitous in other paradigms as it is in FP, but it is certainly not an alien
there. OOP programmers, in particular, are well familiar with the concept and understand its benefits (and its price!)
very well.</p></div></div><div class=sect2><h3 id=_avoiding_inheritance>Avoiding inheritance</h3><div class=paragraph><p>In one of his blog posts John A De Goes says<sup class=footnote>[<a id=_footnoteref_6 class=footnote href=#_footnotedef_6 title="View footnote.">6</a>]</sup>, that</p></div><div class=quoteblock><blockquote><div class=paragraph><p>object-oriented programming—by which I mean inheritance hierarchies (typified by the Scala collections inheritance
hierarchy) and subtyping (beyond its use for modeling sum types, modules, and type classes)—isn’t useful.</p></div></blockquote></div><div class=paragraph><p>I can&#8217;t come up with an example where subtyping is useful on top of those that Mr. De Goes lists. But I want to
highlight, that the target of his claim is inheritance, not, strictly speaking, OOP. Yes, many books say, that
inheritance is one of the pillars of OOP, but some don&#8217;t.</p></div><div class=paragraph><p>Alan Kay, who is considered the inventor of OOP, starts his (quite hard to grok, to be honest) response about inheritance
with this<sup class=footnote>[<a id=_footnoteref_7 class=footnote href=#_footnotedef_7 title="View footnote.">7</a>]</sup>:</p></div><div class=quoteblock><blockquote><div class=paragraph><p>I initially liked the idea — it could be useful — but soon realized that something that would be “mathematically
binding” was really needed because the mechanism itself let too many semantically different things to be “done” (aka
“kluged”) by the programmer.</p></div></blockquote></div><div class=paragraph><p>Polemics about definitions are rarely productive, let&#8217;s see what happens in practice. Joshua&nbsp;Bloch argued for
composition and delegation over inheritance almost 20 years ago too<sup class=footnote>[<a id=_footnoteref_8 class=footnote href=#_footnotedef_8 title="View footnote.">8</a>]</sup>. And maybe, 10 years ago I would still occasionally see 7 levels of inheritance in the new
code. But people don&#8217;t do this anymore. I&#8217;ve seen Java projects, where programmers preferred code duplication over
inheritance, and they believed they were doing OOP. Modern non-FP languages (Go, Rust) do not even offer this design
facility. Inheritance just proved itself practically inconvenient in <em>many</em> cases, and this is not unique to FP.</p></div></div></div></div><div class=sect1><h2 id=_oop_patterns_that_converge_to_fp>OOP Patterns that converge to FP</h2><div class=sectionbody><div class=paragraph><p>Let&#8217;s consider the unfamous <em>Factory</em> pattern. It is useful when in our program we have to construct an object from
some data, but the data is scattered among different points in runtime. So we first feed some part of data to the
factory and then some other part of data when it becomes available:</p></div><div class=listingblock><div class=content><pre class="highlightjs highlight"><code data-lang=java class="language-java hljs">class FooFactory {
    FooFactory(int datum1, int datum2) { ...  }

    Foo buildFoo(int datum3) { ... }
}

FooFactory ff = FooFactory(1, 2);
...
Foo foo = ff.buildFoo(3);</code></pre></div></div><div class=paragraph><p>This is of course just a curried function. Or, saying it differently:</p></div><div class=listingblock><div class=content><pre class="highlightjs highlight"><code data-lang=scala class="language-scala hljs">val buildFoo: (Int, Int) =&gt; Int =&gt; Foo</code></pre></div></div><div class=paragraph><p>Ok, perhaps I&#8217;ll be obliterated for this<sup class=footnote>[<a id=_footnoteref_9 class=footnote href=#_footnotedef_9 title="View footnote.">9</a>]</sup>: one can even make a Factory, that produces a Factory, that produces a
Factory&#8230;&#8203; There&#8217;s also <em>AbstractFactory</em>, which is <em>composed</em> of other factories, and this is&#8230;&#8203; a composition of
higher-order functions!</p></div><div class=paragraph><p>Another example is <em>Strategy</em> pattern, and depending on how exactly it is used, it either resembles a catamorphism
(<code>fold</code>) or a functor <code>map</code>:</p></div><div class=listingblock><div class=content><pre class="highlightjs highlight"><code data-lang=scala class="language-scala hljs">class Aggregator {
    &lt;I,O&gt; O aggregate(Iterable&lt;I&gt; input, AggregationStrategy&lt;T&gt; s)
}</code></pre></div></div><div class=paragraph><p>My favorite would probably be <em>Command</em>. Here you have algebras, suspension of side-effects, representing programs as
values and even quite decent composability.</p></div><div class=listingblock><div class=content><pre class="highlightjs highlight"><code data-lang=java class="language-java hljs">inteface Command {
    void run();
}
class Action1Command implements Command { ... }
class Action2Command implements Command { ... }

class Dispatcher {
    void execute(Command c);
}
class Service {
    Command doAction1() {  ...; return new Action1Command(); }
    Command doAction2() {  ...; return new Action2Command(); }
    ...
}</code></pre></div></div><div class=paragraph><p>My point is, there were real problems that had to be solved, and all those OOP patterns are perfectly valid solutions.
I find it interesting, that although OOP abstractions are built using entirely different building blocks, solutions
produced in the scope of this paradigm are well aligned with solutions that FP paradigm offers.</p></div><div class=paragraph><p>I guess my point is&#8230;&#8203;</p></div></div></div><div class=sect1><h2 id=_dont_make_fp_look_less_approachable_than_it_is>Don&#8217;t make FP look less approachable than it is</h2><div class=sectionbody><div class=paragraph><p>Writing programs using only pure function and immutable data structures may have some benefits. But it does not mean,
that there&#8217;s nothing in between the side-effectfull mutable OOP and idealistic FP. When it comes to solving real-world
problems with code, FP or OOP is a false dichotomy.</p></div><div class=paragraph><p>It is good to be influenced by FP and take the best of it, where it suits you. Already mentioned Rust and Go do not
offer inheritance, allow higher-order functions, employ error propagation models that result in complete functions,
Rust allows parametric polymorphism and offers many monadic structures in its standard library. Yet, both are for from
pure FP. And yet, both are used successfully to solve real problems.</p></div><div class=paragraph><p>And if you have not tried FP but been curious (and you should always be), start small. You&#8217;d better learn FP using a
language that helps you, but you don&#8217;t need to rewrite 10 years old legacy project at work in a new language to get
benefits of FP. Techniques that you acquire through practicing FP may improve your unpure non-functional Java, Python
or JavaScript code, and, as the title says, quite possibly they already did.</p></div></div></div><div id=footnotes><hr><div class=footnote id=_footnotedef_1><a href=#_footnoteref_1>1</a>.
